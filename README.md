# HTB-writeups

This is the repository where I will upload a write up on how I solved retired Hack The Box Machines in order to train and evolve as an Ethical Hacker. They are not meant to be tutorials, but just a guide to be able to solve those same machines or simmilar ones on the future. I will also try to tag them so it is easier to find techniques used on each of them.

The folders are divided into three categories: [easy](https://github.com/AlexadeZ17/HTB-writeups/tree/main/easy), [medium]() and [hard]() which correspond to the dificulty of the machines, and on each one you will find the folders of all the code and info gathered along with it's write up.

Here you can also find an Index if you wish to have a quick overview
